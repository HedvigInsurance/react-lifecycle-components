## Components

### Mount
Takes one prop `on` which is called when the component mounts.

```javascript
    <Mount on={() => console.log("I was mounted!")} />
```

#### Usecase
When you want to perform a side-effect on mount, like sending a tracking event ðŸš€, starting an animation âœ¨, or something like that.
